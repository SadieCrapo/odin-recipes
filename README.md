# odin-recipes
This is a simple recipe website created as I have been following the Odin Project curriculum. The initial website will consist of a homepage with a list of dishes. Each of those dish names will link to a page with the recipe for that dish, as well as a description and picture of the completed food.

The initial site is made with HTML. I will be adding styling with CSS and interactivity with JavaScript as I continue to work through this curriculum.
